# EDA Insights & Graph Explanation

## 1. The "Frequency" Chart (Temporal Trends)

- **What it shows**: A timeline of when people are enrolling vs. updating.
- **The Story**: You can see a massive "heartbeat" or spike around **July 2025**.
- **Why?**: This almost certainly lines up with the **school admission cycle**. Schools require updated Aadhaar cards (especially biometrics for kids), causing a huge rush of parents going to centres in July. This is a predictable "stress event."

## 2. The "Who is Who" Chart (Age Distribution)

- **What it shows**: We split everyone into Babies (0-5), Kids (5-17), and Adults (18+).
- **The Story**:
  - **Babies**: High _Enrolment_. (This is normal; babies are getting their first IDs).
  - **Kids (5-17)**: High _Biometric Updates_. (This means the system works! Kids are turning 5 or 15 and updating their fingerprints/photos as required by law).
  - **Adults**: High _Demographic Updates_. (Adults aren't growing new fingers, so they are just fixing addresses or phone numbers).

## 3. The "Stress Map" (Geographic Scatter)

- **What it shows**: A dot for every district.
  - **X-axis (Bottom)**: How many people enrolled (Size of district).
  - **Y-axis (Left)**: How many updates happened (Workload).
- **The Story**:
  - Most districts cluster near the bottom-left (low enrolment, low updates).
  - **The Outliers**: Some dots are way high up relative to their size (like **Thoubal** and **Imphal**). This means for every 1 person enrolling, there are **100 people updating**.
  - **Meaning**: These districts are "maintenance heavy." They aren't growing; they are just constantly fixing existing data. This is a major "Stress Signal."
