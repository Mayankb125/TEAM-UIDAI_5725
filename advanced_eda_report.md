## 1. State-Age Churn Heatmap

![Churn Heatmap](d:/UIDAI data hackathon/outputs/figures\churn_heatmap.png)

> **Insight**: States with high 'Child' intensity are managing school-age compliance. States with high 'Adult' intensity are dealing with migration/correction.

## 2. Seasonality Decomposition (Biometric Updates)

**Note**: Data duration (10 months) is short for full yearly seasonality analysis, but we will attempt decomposition.
Could not perform decomposition: x must have 2 complete cycles requires 24 observations. x only has 10 observation(s)
